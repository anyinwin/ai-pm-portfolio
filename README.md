# PatientGuide
### AI-powered healthcare navigation for people who are tired of getting burned

---

## The Problem
People make medical appointments on trust — without knowing their real costs, 
whether their provider is actually covered, or the right questions to ask. 
They find out too late, when the bill arrives.

## Who This Is For
English-speaking, insured adults who need to schedule a medical appointment 
and have been surprised by unexpected bills before. They don't know which 
providers are covered under their plan or what to ask before they commit.

## What Exists Today
Nothing connects symptoms, insurance, provider availability, and costs in one 
place. Insurance portals are dense and jargon-heavy. Calling providers gives 
inconsistent answers. There is no guide that tells you what to ask, who to 
ask, and in what order — before it's too late.

## Why AI
This isn't a lookup problem. It's a human conversation that requires 
synthesizing scattered information, anticipating what the user doesn't know 
to ask, and adapting in real time.

A database informs. Claude advocates.

## What PatientGuide Does
1. **Find** — Based on your symptoms, insurance, and location, identify 
covered providers and expected costs before you book
2. **Prepare** — Once you've chosen a provider, generate your personalized 
pre-appointment checklist: exact billing codes to confirm, questions to ask, 
and who to call

## Future Ideas
- Post-appointment: automatically retrieve, store, and organize visit records 
and billing documents
- Especially valuable for chronic condition patients who navigate this 
repeatedly
- Cost map: visualize expected costs by provider type and location based on 
symptoms
