AI PM portfolio - prototypes and product thinking

Product: PatientGuide

User: An English-speaking, insured adult who needs to schedule a medical appointment, feels anxious because they've been surprised by unexpected bills before, don't know which providers are actually covered under their plan, and don't know the right questions to ask before they commit to anyone.

Failure moment: People make appointments on trust — without knowing their coverage, their real costs, or the right questions to ask — and get burned later.

What exists today: Nothing that connects symptoms, insurance, provider availability, and costs in one place. People call and get inconsistent answers. Portals are dense and don't connect to real decisions.

Why AI: Because this isn't a lookup problem. It's a human conversation that requires synthesizing scattered information, anticipating what the user doesn't know to ask, and adapting in real time. A database informs. Claude advocates.
